### This repository is meant to showcase projects I worked on through the Data Structures Course at JHU

## Project 1: [Iterative Prefix to Postfix Notation Converter](https://github.com/zhatz111/Data-Structures-JHU/tree/main/Prefix_Postfix_Converter)

**Language**: Python<br>
**IDE**: VS Code <br>
**Version**: 3.11.1 64-bit<br>

Other Information
To properly run this program there are four arguments on the command line that must be specified. The first is the python executable that is installed on your computer to be able to compile the program itself. The second is the name of the python script with the .py extension following. The third is the path to the input file that is to be converted to postfix. The fourth and last argument is the path to the output file where the converted postfix expression will be written too. A screenshot example of how to run this program and what an error message will look like is shown below.

You can use the cd command to change the starting directory to where the input text file, output text file and the python script are located to reduce the need for long file paths. I specify the four arguments needed to run the program which will take in the input text file and write the converted expressions to the output text file.

This program also contains two separate modules that house important parts of the program. These parts are main.py, which is the main script, and functions.py, which contains necessary functions like blank line removal and the prefix to postfix converter. Both modules need to be in the same folder to run the main script properly since they import each other.


## Project 2: [Recursive Prefix to Postfix Notation Converter](https://github.com/zhatz111/Data-Structures-JHU/tree/main/Recursive_Prefix_Postfix_Converter)

**Language**: Python<br>
**IDE**: VS Code <br>
**Version**: 3.11.1 64-bit<br>

## Project 3: [Huffman Encoding Tree](https://github.com/zhatz111/Data-Structures-JHU/tree/main/Huffman_Encoding_Tree)

**Language**: Python<br>
**IDE**: VS Code <br>
**Version**: 3.11.1 64-bit<br> 

Other Information
To properly run this program there are six arguments on the command line that must be specified. The first is the python executable that is installed on your computer to be able to compile the program itself. The second is the name of the python script with the .py extension following. The third is the path to the frequency table needed to create the huffman tree. The fourth is the path to the clear text file of string that you wish to convert to Huffman encoded bits. The fifth is the encoded bits file that you wish to decode back into a readable string. The last is the output text file to store the output generated from the script. If the output text file was not created prior to running the script, the script will create it based on whatever name and extension you provide it.  A screenshot example of how to run this program and what a normal output to the console will look like if the arguments are specified correctly.

You can use the cd command to change the starting directory to where the files and the python script are located to reduce the need for long file paths, which is what was done in the screenshot above.

This program also contains two separate modules that house important parts of the program. These
parts are main.py, which is the main script, and functions.py, which contains necessary classes and methods such as the huffman encoding class and preorder traversal method. Both python files need to be in the same folder to run the main script properly since they import each other.


## Project 4: [Quicksort vs MergeSort Algorithm Comparison](https://github.com/zhatz111/Data-Structures-JHU/tree/main/Sorting_Algorithm_Comparison)

**Language**: Python<br>
**IDE**: VS Code <br>
**Version**: 3.11.1 64-bit<br>

Other Information
To properly run this program there are four arguments on the command line that must be specified. The first is the python executable that is installed on your computer to be able to compile the program itself. The second is the name of the python script with the .py extension following. The third is the input directory folder where the files that need to be sorted are stored. The fourth and last argument is the output file name to obtain the output from the program in a text file. A screenshot example of how to run this program and what a normal output to the console will look like if the arguments are specified correctly.

The output to the terminal will tell you what file is being sorted and when it is completed. Once all files in the input directory are sorted they will be stored in the output file specified and the program will tell you when the output file is ready to be viewed. 

You can use the cd command to change the starting directory to where the files and the python script are located to reduce the need for long file paths, which is what was done in the screenshot above.

This program also contains two separate modules that house important parts of the program. These
parts are main.py, which is the main script, and functions.py, which contains necessary classes and methods such as the quicksort and mergesort classes. Both python files need to be in the same folder to run the main script properly since they import each other.
